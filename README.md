# RAG Chatbot for Italian Cuisine ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot focused on Italian cuisine.  
It uses a vector database and a language model to answer user queries about recipes, ingredients, cooking techniques, and regional specialties.  

The chatbotâ€™s knowledge base is powered by a JSON file, which can be extended with more data to improve the quality and scope of responses.
