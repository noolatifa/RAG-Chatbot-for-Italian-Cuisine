    "HOW TO COOK PASTA PERFECTLY\nCooking pasta is simple, but small details make a big difference. Follow these steps:\nSTEP 1: BOIL WATER\n- Use 4-6 quarts of water per pound of pasta.\n- Always use a large pot so the pasta has room to move.\nSTEP 2: SALT THE WATER\n- Add 1-2 tablespoons of salt once the water is boiling.\n- Salt enhances the pasta’s natural flavor.\nSTEP 3: ADD PASTA & STIR\n- Drop pasta into boiling water and stir immediately to prevent sticking.\n- Stir occasionally throughout cooking.\nSTEP 4: COOK TO AL DENTE\n- 'Al dente' means firm but not hard.\n- Check the package for cooking time, but start testing 1-2 minutes before.\nSTEP 5: SAVE PASTA WATER\n- Reserve ½ to 1 cup of pasta water before draining.\n- The starchy water helps sauces stick better.\nSTEP 6: DRAIN, BUT DON’T RINSE\n- Never rinse pasta! It removes the starch that helps sauce cling.\n- If using immediately, toss it with your sauce right away.\n- If storing, mix with a little olive oil to prevent sticking.\nBONUS TIPS\n- For extra flavor, cook pasta in broth instead of water.\n- For a firmer texture, drain pasta 1 minute early and finish cooking in the sauce.",

    "TYPES OF PASTA & BEST USES\nDifferent pasta shapes work better with specific sauces.\nLONG PASTA (Best for Light or Oil-Based Sauces)\n- Spaghetti – Classic for marinara, carbonara, and garlic oil sauces.\n- Linguine – Slightly wider than spaghetti, great with seafood-based sauces.\n- Fettuccine – Flat and thick, perfect for creamy sauces like Alfredo.\n- Angel Hair – Very thin, best with delicate tomato or olive oil sauces.\nSHORT PASTA (Best for Chunky or Thick Sauces)\n- Penne – Tube-shaped, holds meat or vegetable-based sauces well.\n- Rigatoni – Larger tubes, great for baked pasta dishes and rich sauces.\n- Fusilli – Spiral shape helps capture thick sauces.\n- Farfalle (Bow-Tie) – Works well in pasta salads and light creamy sauces.\nSMALL PASTA (Great for Soups & Salads)\n- Orzo – Small, rice-shaped pasta for soups, salads, or side dishes.\n- Ditalini – Tiny tubes, common in Italian soups like minestrone.\nSTUFFED PASTA (Used in Special Dishes)\n- Ravioli – Square-shaped and stuffed with cheese, meat, or spinach.\n- Tortellini – Ring-shaped and usually filled with cheese or meat.\n- Lasagna Sheets – Used for layered baked pasta dishes.\nCHOOSING THE RIGHT PASTA\n- Thicker, heavier sauces (like Alfredo or Bolognese) need sturdy pasta like fettuccine or rigatoni.\n- Lighter, oil-based sauces (like pesto or garlic & oil) pair well with long, thin pasta.\n- Baked dishes work best with tubular pasta like penne or rigatoni.",
